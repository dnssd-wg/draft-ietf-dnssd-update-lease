      <t>This document describes an EDNS0 option that can be used by DNS Update requestors and
      DNS servers to include a lease lifetime in a DNS Update or response, allowing a server to garbage collect stale
      resource records that have been added by DNS Updates</t>

      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>Dynamic DNS Update <xref target="RFC2136"/> allows for a mapping from a persistent
      hostname to a dynamic IP address. This capability is particularly
      beneficial to mobile hosts, whose IP address may frequently change
      with location. However, the mobile nature of such hosts often means
      that dynamically updated resource records are not properly
      deleted. Consider, for instance, a mobile user who publishes address
      records via dynamic update. If this user moves
      their laptop out of range of the Wi-Fi access point,
      the address record containing stale information
      may remain on the server indefinitely.
      An extension to Dynamic Update is
      thus required to tell the server to automatically delete resource
      records if they are not refreshed after a period of time.</t>

      <t>Note that overloading the resource record TTL <xref target="RFC1035"/> is not
      appropriate for purposes of garbage collection. Data that is
      susceptible to frequent change or invalidation, thus requiring a
      garbage collection mechanism, needs a relatively short resource
      record TTL to avoid polluting intermediate DNS caches with stale
      data. Using this TTL, short enough to minimize stale cached data,
      as a garbage collection lease lifetime would result in an unacceptable
      amount of network traffic due to refreshes
      (see <xref target="refresh"/> "Refresh Messages").</t>

      <t>The EDNS0 Update Lease option is included in a standard DNS Update message <xref
      target="RFC2136"/> within an EDNS(0) OPT pseudo-RR <xref target="RFC6891"/>.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="update">
      <name>Update Message Format</name>
      <t>
      Dynamic DNS Update Leases Requests and Responses are formatted as standard DNS Dynamic
      Update messages <xref target="RFC2136"/>. This update MUST include the EDNS0 OPT RR, as
      described in <xref target="RFC6891"/>.  This OPT RR MUST include an EDNS0 Option as shown
      below.  Note that if a TSIG resource record (<xref target="RFC2845"/>) is included to
      authenticate the update, the TSIG RR should appear <em>after</em> the OPT RR, allowing the
      message digest in the TSIG to cover the OPT RR.</t>

      <t>The Update Lease EDNS0 option is formatted as follows:</t>

<figure align="center" anchor="lease_opt" suppress-title="true"><artwork align="center"><![CDATA[
Field Name       Field Type   Description
----------------------------------------------------------------
OPTION-CODE      u_int16_t    UPDATE-LEASE (2)
OPTION-LENGTH    u_int16_t    4 or 8
LEASE            u_int32_t    desired lease (request) or
                              granted lease (response), in seconds
KEY-LEASE        u_int32_t    optional desired (or granted)
                              lease for KEY records, in seconds
]]></artwork></figure>

      <t>Update Requests contain, in the LEASE field of the OPT RDATA, an
      unsigned 32-bit integer indicating the lease lifetime, in seconds, desired
      by the requestor, represented in network (big-endian) byte order.
      In Update Responses, this field contains the actual
      lease granted by the server. The lease granted by the
      server may be less than, greater than, or equal to the value
      requested by the requestor.</t>

      <t>There are two variants of the EDNS(0) UPDATE-LEASE option,
      the basic (4-byte) variant and the extended (8-byte) variant.</t>

      <t>In the basic (4-byte) variant, the LEASE indicated in the
      Update Lease option applies to all resource records in the Update section.</t>

      <t>In the extended (8-byte) variant, the Update Lease communicates two lease lifetimes.
      The LEASE indicated in the Update Lease option applies to all resource records in the
      Update section *except* for KEY records.  The KEY-LEASE indicated in the Update Lease
      option applies to KEY records in the Update section.</t>

      <t>The reason the KEY record can be given a special lease time is that this record is used
      in the DNS-SD Service Registration Protocol <xref target="I-D.ietf-dnssd-srp"/> to reserve
      a name (or names) when the service is not present.</t>

      <section anchor="requestor">
	<name>Requestor Behavior</name>
	<t>DNS Update requestors SHOULD send an Update Lease option with any DNS Update that is not
	intended to be present indefinitely. The Update Lease option SHOULD specify a time
	interval that is no shorter than 30 minutes (1800 seconds). Requestors that expect the
	updated records to be relatively static MAY request appropriately longer leases.</t>

	<t>If the DNS response received by the requestor does not include an Update Lease option,
	this is an indication that the DNS server does not support the Update Lease option. The
	requestor SHOULD in this case continue sending refresh messages (see below) as if the
	server had returned an identical update lease option in its response.</t>

	<t>If the DNS response does include an Update Lease option, the requestor MUST use the
	interval(s) returned in this option when determining when to send Refresh messages. This
	is true both if the interval(s) returned by the server are shorter and if they are
	longer.</t>
      </section>

      <section>
	<name>Server Behavior</name>
	<t>DNS Servers implementing the Update Lease option MUST include an Update Lease option
	in response to any successful DNS Update (RCODE=0) that includes an Update Lease option.
	Servers MAY return different lease interval(s) than specified by the requestor, granting
	relatively longer or shorter leases to reduce network traffic due to Refreshes, or
	reduce stale data, respectively.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section anchor="refresh">
      <name>Refresh Messages</name>

      <t>A Refresh message is a DNS Update message that is sent to the server after an initial
      DNS Update has been sent, in order to prevent the updates records from being garbage
      collected.</t>

      <section>
	<name>Refresh Message Format</name>

        <t>Refresh messages are formatted like Dynamic Update Leases Requests and Responses (see
        <xref target="update"/> "Update Message Format"). The Refresh message should be
        constructed with the assumption that the result of the previous update or Refresh is
        still in effect. The Refresh message should, in the case that the records added in a
        previous update were for some reason garbage collected, result in those records being
        added again.</t>

	<t>The Refresh message should not include any update prerequisites that would, if the state
	produced by the previous update or Refresh is still in effect, fail. The update should not
	be constructed to fail in the case that the state produced by the previous update or Refresh
	has for some reason been garbage collected.</t>

	<t>An update message that changes the server state resulting from a previous Refresh or
	update is an update, not a Refresh.</t>

	<t>The Update Lease option in a Refresh contains the desired new lease on Requests, and
	the actual granted lease on Responses. The LEASE interval indicated in the Update Lease
	option applies to all resource records in the Update section, except that if a KEY-LEASE
	interval is included as well, that interval applies to any KEY records included in the
	Update section.</t>
      </section>

      <section>
	<name>Requestor Behavior</name>

	<t>A requestor that intends that its records from a previous update, whether an initial
	update or a Refresh, MUST send a Refresh message before the lease elapses, or else the records
	will be removed by the server.</t>

	<t>Requestors SHOULD Refresh resource records after 75% of the original lease has
	elapsed. If the requestor uses UDP and does not receive a response from the server, the
	requestor SHOULD retry after 2 seconds. The requestor SHOULD continue to retry, doubling the
	length of time between each retry, or retry using TCP.</t>

	<t>For Refresh messages, the server is expected to return an Update Lease option, if
	supported, just as with the initial update. As with the initial update, the requestor MUST
	use the interval(s) specified by the server when determining when to send the next
	Refresh message.</t>

	<t>When sending Refresh messages, the requestor MUST include an Update Lease option, as it
	did for the initial Update. The Update Lease option MAY either specify the same
	intervals as in the initial Update, or MAY use the values returned by the server in the
	previous Update, whether it was an initil Update or a Refresh.</t>

	<section>
	  <name>Coalescing Refresh Messages</name>
          <t>If the requestor has performed multiple successful updates with a single server,
          the requestor MAY include Refreshes for all such updates to that server in a single
          message. This effectively places all records for a requestor on the same expiration
          schedule, reducing network traffic due to Refreshes.</t>

	  <t>In doing so, the requestor includes in the Refresh message all existing updates to
	  the server, including those not yet close to expiration, so long as at least one
	  resource record in the message has elapsed at least 75% of its original lease. If the
	  requestor uses UDP, the requestor MUST NOT coalesce Refresh messages if doing so would
	  cause truncation of the message; in this case, multiple messages or TCP should be
	  used.</t>

	  <t>Requestors SHOULD NOT send a Refresh messages when all of the records in the
	  Refresh have more than 50% of their lease interval remaining before expiry. However,
	  there may be cases where the requestor needs to send an early refresh, and it MAY do
	  so. For example, a power-constrained device may need to send an update when the radio
	  is powered so as to avoid having to power it up later.</t>

	  <t>Another case where this may be needed is if the lease interval registered with the
	  server is no longer appropriate and the Requestor wishes to negotiate a different
	  lease interval. However, in this case, if the server does not honor the requested
	  interval in its response, the requestor MUST NOT retry this negotiation.</t>
	</section>
      </section>

      <section>
	<name>Server Behavior</name>
        <t>Upon receiving a valid Refresh Request, the server MUST send an acknowledgment. This
        acknowledgment is identical to the Update Response format described in <xref
        target="update"/> "Update Message Format", and contains the new lease of the resource
        records being Refreshed.  The server MUST NOT increment the SOA serial number of a zone
        as the result of a Refresh.</t>

	<t>However, the server's state may not match what the client expects.  In this case, a
	Refresh may actually appear to be an Update from the server's perspective. In this case,
	if the Update changes the contents of the zone, the server MUST update the zone serial
	number.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section>
      <name>Garbage Collection</name>
      <t>If the Update Lease of a resource record elapses without being
      refreshed, the server MUST NOT return the expired record in answers
      to queries. The server MAY delete the record from its database.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>When DNS Update is enabled on an authoritative server,
      the Security Considerations of that specification <xref target="RFC2136"/>
      should be considered.</t>

      <t>The addition of a record lifetime to facilitate automated garbage collection
      does not itself add any significant new security concerns.</t>
    </section>

    <section>
      <name>IANA Considerations</name>
      <t>The EDNS(0) OPTION CODE 2 has already been assigned for this DNS
      extension. No additional IANA services are required by this document.</t>
