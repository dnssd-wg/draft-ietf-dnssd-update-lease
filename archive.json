And also reregister at 75% of lease time all around the same time.\r\n\r\n* In lighting systems, it's quite common to have 100s/1000s of identical (networked) devices. So these would all register an identical service with identical lease time, if they would use DNS-SD / SRP. (Use of SRP for such systems is uncommon today but may be used in the future.)\r\n\r\nProbably the term 'SHOULD' was used for these timers to allow some local variation.

If a server receives a 4-byte variant, it MUST respond with a 4-byte variant.\r\n \r\nDoes this sentence combo mean:\r\nServer MUST support 4-byte and 8-byte variant; and\r\nClient MUST support 4-byte and 8-byte variant.\r\n \r\nOr rather does it mean:\r\nServer MUST support 4-byte and 8-byte variant; and\r\nClient MUST support 4-byte variant and MAY support 8-byte variant.   (Since a 4-byte-only client would never receive an 8-byte variant!)\r\n \r\nDid we intend to say the former, or the latter, or leave it in the middle? In practice a client can be implemented fully without support for the 8-byte variant regardless of our intentions here.\r\nSo not even sure we need to do anything here, but wanted to highlight the potential unclarity.",
